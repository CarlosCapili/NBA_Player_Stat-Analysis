# NBA Player Stat Analysis
I was interested in playing around with NBA player stats and and found one on Kaggle. I used it to find **trivial stats** such as who is the oldest and youngest player on each team per season and some **performance stats** such as players having the best ppg, rbg, apg, etc. 

* Note I will continue to add more NBA data to my database on pgAdmin and will add more queries to this one. This is just the beginning.

### Tools
- pgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL)
- PowerShell (Using Git for version control on Windows 10)

### PowerBI Dashboard (In Progress)
