# NBA Player Stat Analysis
I was interested in playing around with NBA player stats and and found one on Kaggle. I used it to find **trivial stats** such as who is the oldest and youngest player on each team per season and some **performance stats** such as players having the best ppg, rbg, apg, etc.
